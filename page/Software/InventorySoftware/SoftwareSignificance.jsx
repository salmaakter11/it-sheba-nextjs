                                    Bangladesh's economy is expanding quickly, drawing in both domestic
                                    and foreign capital. The amount of goods and products on the market
                                    is growing as businesses grow. By ensuring they meet customer
                                    demands while minimising costs, companies can keep up with this
                                    growth with the aid of effective inventory management.

                                    In Bangladesh, a lot of companies continue to use antiquated manual

                                    errors. Ineffective inventory control can cause financial losses and
                                    disgruntled customers by overstocking or understocking.
