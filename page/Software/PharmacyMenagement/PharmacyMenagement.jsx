                                    The main purpose of pharmacy management is to oversee the inventory
                                    of medications, particularly those that are typically on every
                                    customer's most-demanded list. Additionally, remember to keep track
                                    of bills, replenish, and discard expired ones. All tasks, including
                                    general operations and administrative finance, are combined into a
                                    single system by SMART PHARMA. We are aware of the difficulties and

                                    e-Pharmacy, will be discussed below. A managing system that includes

                                    provides a string search method that allows users to look up any
                                    drug by either using its name code or description of drugs.
