                                A school management system is a collection of computer programmes
                                designed to assist schools in handling their regular administrative
                                duties. Schools can monitor their everyday operations and manage all
                                of their data and resources on one platform by implementing a school
                                management system. Nowadays, the majority of schools use school
                                management systems to increase productivity and efficiency while
                                cutting down on the amount of time spent on administrative duties.
                                The burden of handling copious amounts of data from schools is also
                                lessened with this method.
