                                    Telemarketing has turned into a crucial component of any business
                                    plan in the fast-paced business world of today. It's the process of
                                    conducting phone-based product or service sales. IT SHEBA has chosen
                                    to launch a telemarketing company because they recognise its
                                    potential. We will describe what it is, how it operates, its
                                    advantages, and the expenses associated with operating this business
                                    in this post.

                                <h4>What is Telemarketing?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    It operates by calling prospective clients or leads and making
                                    offers of goods and services. Telemarketers are trained to address
                                    objections and provide information about the product or service
                                    being offered. They use scripts to help them navigate the
                                    conversation. CRM software is also used by telemarketers to manage
                                    customer information, schedule appointments, and keep track of
                                    leads.
