                                    Why SMS Marketing Matters in Bangladesh:

                                        High Mobile Penetration: With over 180 million mobile subscribers,
                                        Bangladesh boasts one of the highest penetration rates in the
                                        world. This means your SMS campaigns have a high chance of
                                        reaching your target audience directly in their pockets.

                                        Limited Internet Access: While internet access is steadily
                                        increasing, it still remains unevenly distributed across the
                                        country. SMS bypasses this barrier, ensuring your message reaches
                                        even those without consistent internet connectivity.

                                        High Open Rates: Studies reveal that SMS messages are more likely
                                        to be opened than emails, with an open rate of over 98%. This
                                        makes SMS messages a very powerful tool for drawing in readers and
                                        getting your point through.

                                        Personalisation and Targeting: Compared to other channels, SMS
                                        offers a degree of personalisation and targeting that is
                                        challenging to attain. You can target recipients with messages
                                        that are relevant to them individually by segmenting your audience
                                        according to their demographics, interests, and past purchases.

                                        Cost-Effectiveness: SMS marketing has a higher return on
                                        investment than other marketing channels. The reach and engagement
                                        potential can greatly increase your sales and brand awareness, and
                                        the cost per message is very low.
