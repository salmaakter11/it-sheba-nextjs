                  Masking SMS: What Is It? Using a technique called "masking SMS,"
                  which is also referred to as "Sender ID" or "SMS Spoofing,"
                  companies can send text messages to their clients with a
                  personalised sender name displayed in place of the typical phone
                  number. This cutting-edge approach to communication has become
                  well-liked in Bangladesh because it can improve customer
                  interaction, establish brand identity, and foster trust.

                  <li>
                    Brand Recognition: The capacity of Masking SMS to strengthen brand
                    recognition is one of its main benefits. Businesses can establish
                    a unique brand identity in their customers' eyes by using a
                    memorable sender name.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Building Trust: Building trust is essential to any business
                    partnership. SMS masking increases response and engagement rates
                    by making it more likely for recipients to open and trust messages
                    from a known sender.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Higher Open Rates: Poor open rates are a common problem for
                    traditional SMS marketing. Conversely, masked SMS draws the
                    recipient's attention and encourages them to read messages from
                    reputable and well-known sources.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Employees: You can add unlimited stuff with an individual access
                    level. An employee can use this software according to their access
                    level.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Personalised Communication: By using a sender name that aligns
                    with their campaign or brand, businesses can use masking SMS to
                    personalise their communications. The success of marketing
                    campaigns can be greatly impacted by this personalised touch.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Decreased Message Filtering: Masking SMS enables businesses to get
                    around message filters in a time when fraudulent and spam messages
                    are common. It is less likely that messages from reputable senders
                    will be tagged as spam.
