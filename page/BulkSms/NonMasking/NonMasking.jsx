                                <p>
                                    Non Masking SMS refers to a messaging solution that does not conceal
                                    the senderâ€™s identity, providing recipients with a transparent view
                                    of the source. Unlike traditional SMS, which often uses masking to
                                    display generic sender IDs, Non Masking SMS allows businesses and
                                    individuals to communicate with their audience in a more direct and
                                    trustworthy manner.

                                        Authenticity: By revealing the true sender's identity, non-masked
