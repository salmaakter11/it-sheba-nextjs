                                    A Private Automatic Branch Exchange is known as a PABX. It is a
                                    phone system that enables companies to make internal calls as well
                                    as out-of-office calls. It is a private branch exchange that uses a
                                    single central switchboard to connect lines from various locations
                                    or businesses. Additionally, it can be utilised for intercom use,
                                    allowing staff members to communicate without utilising the main
                                    switchboard. It is usually installed in an office or business,
                                    enabling users to receive and make voice calls on their desk phones
                                    and office phones. In addition, it offers voicemail, call parking,
                                    call forwarding, and other features that are typically not found on
                                    regular phones. With the help of an analogue switch, users can
                                    configure the single telephone line—which is shared by all users on
                                    the same network—to function as either an analogue or digital line
                                    for making and receiving calls.
