                                One security tactic that permits one location to view, use, or
                                control another location is the use of an access control device. The
                                thumb (tipshoi) attendance machine, a device used for access
                                control, is also utilised to record attendance time. These safety
                                devices can be used to provide security for various types of work in
                                a variety of settings, including banks, offices, schools, and
                                colleges. It is helpful to know that a variety of factors affect
                                access control.

                                Security can be achieved through access control using a keypad,
                                RFID, face, retina, and finger methods.

                                    Fingerprint system: Fingerprint access control is the technique
                                    that grants access by scanning the fingers. Data input
                                    pre-registers this system. The latter operates on the basis of
                                    earlier data.

                                    Retinal system: The photosensitive screen located behind the eye
                                    is called the retina. Its retina is scanned internally using
                                    cutting-edge access control technology to enter data. As a result,
                                    the access control scans using the previously provided information
                                    when its light strikes the eye.
